- Investigate possibility of switching GUI to PyQt

- Finish re-implementing FieldWidget functionality
-- adding children (DONE)
--- fix widgets below not moving down when child added (DONE)
-- moving FieldWidgets up (DONE)
-- deleting FieldWidgets (see FIXME)
--- FIXME: a child fieldwidget with children deleted above a block that has children on the same 
---- indentation level will cause the blocks below to move up too far and throw bad row value. needs debugger time.
-- Template transferance? Template class??


- when switching from main menu to any other screen, hide the target screen until its setup script is done running
-- (add "loading" screen)
- bind tooltips to FieldWidgets

- Add comment functionality in block creator (comment tag that just lets reader know to put # before line)
- Add settings menu (accessible in topbar and main menu)
- Add topbar menu

- Add scopes/scope-checking!!
- Add actual hoi4 tags, organized such that the program knows what tags go in which scope
- Add error checking for block creator (after above two)


- once above is done:
-- add dynamically updating output preview window
- add file loading
- add file inspection (ability to open any block from a loaded file)
- add proper error logging (send all log messages to file instead of(or as well as???) terminal)
- add file output
- make the gui look nicer
